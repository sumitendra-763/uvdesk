[UVDesk Package Manager][1] is a generic purpose [Composer][2] plugin to help developers auto-configure their packages and its dependencies with varying level of complexeties.

>**Note:**
>Although the main purpose of building this plugin was to aid with configuration of the [UVDesk Community Edition][3] built on top of [Symfony][4], it has no real dependencies on either projects. You should be able to use it freely to configure your composer packages however you want.
